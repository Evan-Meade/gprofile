# gprofile

LEGACY USE ONLY: Backup of predecessor to gprofile2

Statistically characterizes gravitational lensing of gravitational waves. Utilizes glafic to model lensed systems, then iterates over a given sampling space to plot minimum time delay between image pairs created by lensing.

For successor repository with new and improved frameworks, use gprofile2: https://github.com/Evan-Meade/gprofile2. The new code is so different as to be fundamentally distinct from the original gprofile, and so was separated into a separate repository. This repository remains available for reference.
